# 1)
# -STACKS
# The order of insertion for stacks is first come in, last come out. You can think of it like stacking a tower of plates where
# the one on the bottom (the first to be placed down) will be the last one removed.
# -QUEUE
# A queue is like standing in a line, first one in is going to be the first one out.

# 2)
# Linked List: Time complexity is O(n)
# Hash Table: Time complexity is O(1)
# Binary Search Tree: O(log(n))
#
# 3)
# A hash table will instantly give you your value since the hashing function gives you the index (bucket) to jump to in a hash table, while in an array you might not
# know what index to jump to right away so you will have to iterate through it (O(n) complexity in an array vs O(1) complexity in a hash table).
